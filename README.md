# lichdom-in-python
This is an implementation of the solo journaling TTRPG Lichdom.  Whereas the base game was designed to be played
with dice, a standard 52-card deck, pens, and paper, this version is (currently) meant to be played through the
python REPL.

I'm hoping this improves some things I found frustrating about the player experience:
* Physically journaling my game made it hard to share with others online
* Maintaining the state of the deck between play sessions was tedious
* Flipping back and forth in the PDF / physical book when drawing cards slowed play

# TODOs
* Don't prompt for hand display with 0 cards
* Don't prompt for influence selection with 0 cards
* Don't allow spend resolve when spending resolve would kill you
* Print the correct scheme or scry depending on card theme
* Don't offer doom re-roll on 3 doom or more
* Clean up text display
* Add saving & loading of game state so sessions are resumable
* Add ability to flush text prompts into some archival format
* Implement a proper state machine & command / action pattern for game logic
